Explanation:
1.	Image Preprocessing: The images are first converted to grayscale, and the Laplace operator is applied to detect edges, which is useful for identifying retinal abnormalities.
2.	Feature Extraction: The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is used as an example feature extraction technique. Depending on the dataset and requirements, this can be replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated methods.
3.	Model Training: The SVM classifier is trained on the extracted features to distinguish between positive (with abnormalities) and negative (without abnormalities) cases.
4.	Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy and classification report
