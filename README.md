In diabetic retinopathy, fundus imaging plays a crucial role in monitoring retinal abnormalities, which are common and can lead to serious consequences. Fundus images are particularly sensitive to vascular diseases, making them a valuable non-invasive tool for diabetes screening. The accuracy of detecting abnormalities in these images depends significantly on the quality of image capture and the effectiveness of the algorithms used for image processing.

To tackle this challenge, various algorithms have been proposed by research groups. However, the lack of commonly accepted and representative fundus image databases and evaluation protocols hinders the ability to judge the accuracy and reliability of these approaches. The standard evaluation protocol includes metrics such as sensitivity and selectivity, which are crucial for determining the effectiveness of screening programs.

In this project, we focused on evaluating methods for the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, with an emphasis on early detection. We utilized advanced data science techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Feature Vector Machines (FVM), and the Laplace operator, to develop accurate and reliable image processing algorithms. These methods were applied to fundus images to detect and classify retinal abnormalities associated with diabetic retinopathy.

The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in detecting diabetic retinopathy, highlighting the importance of investing in screening programs for early diagnosis. Given that up to one-third of people with diabetes may experience progressive diabetic retinopathy without any symptoms of reduced vision, early detection through reliable algorithms is critical.
