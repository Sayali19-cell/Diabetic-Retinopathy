# Diabetic-Retinopathy
In diabetic retinopathy, Fundus imaging has an important role for monitoring  since occurrences of retinal abnormalities are common and consequences are serious. 
However,  fundus images  seems to be sensitive to vascular diseases, that is considered as a  non-invasive screening of diabetes. 
The screening  of fundus image depends on the rate of accuracy of fundus image capturing and especially on algorithms  accurate and reliable image 
processing for detecting the abnormalities of fundus images. 
There are various algorithms that have been proposed by many research groups for such purposes. 
Because of the lack of commonly accepted and representative fundus image databases and evaluation protocol makes it impossible to judge 
the accuracy and reliability of the approach of particular diseases. The commonly accepted protocol includes sensitivity and selectivity. 
This may sometimes  allow  the technology transfer from research for practice. The main contribution of this work is to evaluate 
methods for diagnosis  of diabetic retinopathy. Experimental results for detection of  Diabetic Retinopathy are reported. 
In order to achieve early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy a major effort will have to be invested into screening programs. 
Screening is important as to one third of people with diabetes that may have progressive Diabetic Retinopathy changes without any symptoms of reduced vision of retina
