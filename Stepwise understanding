1.Start

2.Data Collection
•	Source: Fundus images of the retina from medical databases.
•	Labels: Annotation of images as diabetic retinopathy stages (e.g., no DR, mild, moderate, severe, proliferative DR).

3.Data Preprocessing
•	Image Resizing: Standardize image dimensions.
•	Normalization: Adjust pixel values for consistent input.
•	Augmentation: Apply techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to increase dataset size.

4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Visualize Images: Check for quality and variations in the dataset.
•	Class Distribution: Analyze the distribution of different stages of diabetic retinopathy.

5.Data Splitting
•	Train/Test Split: Divide data into training (e.g., 80%) and test (e.g., 20%) sets.

6.Feature Extraction
•	Techniques: Use methods like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Laplace operator, and others to extract features from images.

7.Model Selection
•	Algorithm Choice: Select models such as SVM(Support Vector Machine) for image classification.

8.Model Training
•	Train the SVM model on the training dataset using extracted features.

9.Model Evaluation
•	Metrics: Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC curve.

10.Model Optimization
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize parameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
•	Model Refinement: Address overfitting or underfitting.

11.Model Testing
•	Validate the final model on the test dataset.

12.Model Deployment
•	Integrate the model into a clinical decision support system for real-time detection.

13.Monitoring and Maintenance
•	Monitor model performance over time.
•	Update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
